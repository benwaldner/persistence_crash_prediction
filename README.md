# persistence_crash_prediction

Using tools for persistent homology (in particular persistence landscapes, a way to embed persistence diagrams in a Banach space) to create robust predictors of crash or regime transition times.

Example on synthetic data (stochastic Henon map with chaotic bifurcation) and financial data (S&P 500 and EuroStoxx sectorial returns from the 1990s to nowadays).

Based on [Topological Data Analysis of Financial Time Series:Landscapes of Crashes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04385.pdf).
